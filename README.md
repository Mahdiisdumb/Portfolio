# Mahdiisdumb Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my **personal portfolio website**, hosted at:

👉 https://mahdiisdumb.vercel.app/

It’s a **self‑hosted portfolio site** that showcases who I am and what I do, including links to my projects, web dev work, and contact info.

## What This Is

This is a **personal portfolio website** built with standard web technologies:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

It’s designed to show a snapshot of me and my work online — the place people can visit to see what I build and who I am. 

## Live Demo

Check out the live portfolio here:

## Features

- A homepage that highlights me
- Links to my social profiles and projects
- Clean, minimal design
- Works across modern browsers

This repo is exactly what runs the live site — no proxy, no external hosting shenanigans.
